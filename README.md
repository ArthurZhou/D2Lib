## Installations
Hi there! Thank you for choose this project!

Before you download anything, you need to know that you only need to download .py file.All .md, .html, .css or .sh file are not required when running the programme!

*.zip* file under every releases is a simple template. If you have no idea about how to build your own library, you may want to hav a look at that.

## Runtime
[Python3.7.2](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-372/)

We only have source releases now, because it'll be easier for you to change options and docs.And, nobody wants to run a packed application on his/her server, I think :)
